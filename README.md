# Flower-Image-Classifier-Project-Pytorch-Challenge
This project is for Facebook/Udacity Pytorch challenge.  I built an image classifier based on pretrained model (desnet121)  to identify different species (102) of flowers. With 18 epochs training, 95.5% accuracy in the validation data set was achieved.
